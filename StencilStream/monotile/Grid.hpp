/**
 * \brief A grid class for the monotile architecture
 *
 * This grid, which fullfils the \ref stencil::concepts::Grid "Grid" concept, contains a
 * two-dimensional buffer of cells to be used together with the \ref StencilUpdate class.
 *
 * The contents of the grid can be accessed by a host-side program using the \ref GridAccessor class
 * template. For example, one can write the contents of a `grid` object as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * Grid::GridAccessor<sycl::access::mode::read_write> accessor(grid);
 * for (uindex_t c = 0; c < grid.get_grid_width(); c++) {
 *     for (uindex_t r = 0; r < grid.get_grid_height(); r++) {
 *         accessor[c][r] = foo(c, r);
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, one may write their data into a SYCL buffer and copy it into the grid using the
 * method \ref copy_from_buffer. The method \ref copy_to_buffer does the reverse: It writes the
 * contents of the grid into a SYCL buffer.
 *
 * On the device side, the data can be read or written with the help of the method templates \ref
 * submit_read and \ref submit_write. Those take a SYCL pipe as a template argumment and enqueue
 * kernels that read/write the contents of the grid to/from the pipes.
 *
 * \tparam Cell The cell type to store.
 *
 * \tparam word_size The word size of the memory system, in bytes. This is used to optimize the
 * kernels submitted by \ref submit_read and \ref submit_write.
